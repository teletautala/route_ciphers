# route_ciphers
This repository will provide the functionality to encrypt and decrypt route ciphers

The idea behind a route cipher is to place the plaintext in a grid in a specific pattern, then use a different pattern to create the cipher text.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Route_cipher for more detail.
I am trying to create a suite of objects that do this.
